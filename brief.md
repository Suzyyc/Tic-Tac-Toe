# Project #1

## Make a game!

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

You have two options:

**Option A: make Tic Tac Toe (XO)**

**Option B: make any game you want!**

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

### Technical Requirements

## Option A: Tic Tac Toe:

Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

- **Render a game board in the browser**
- **Switch turns** between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- **Visually display which side won** if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- **Deploy your game to GitHub Pages** where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Have well-formatted, and well-commented code (follow these [HTML & CSS Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html))
- Some unique features that distinguish your game from the "normal" solution listed above. Here are some ideas:

#### Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features

- Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter
- Allow players to **customize their tokens** (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects or animations
- **Use LocalStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
- Implement a **reset button** that resets the game without refreshing the whole page
- Involve **Audio** in your game
- Add a **simple AI** to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
- Implement a **turn timer** so that if a player takes too long without making a move, a random move is made for them
- **Support custom board sizes**: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
- **Support networked multiplayer**: [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) has a nice quickstart guide

## Option B: Any game you want!

If you are feeling creative and want to try something new, then go for it! In order to go this route you must run your idea by the instructional team first.

- your proposal must include: a summary of your idea, a wire frame ([this](https://wireframe.cc/) is a good site to make wireframes), what you think the biggest challenges will be.
- Proposals are flexible! You are welcome to update and adjust these as the project continues.

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages
- A **landing page** with the name of your game, instructions and a start button
- A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repository
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning of the project_
- **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.

## README Suggestions

- List technologies used
- Link to wireframes and user stories.
- Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
- List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- Describe how some of your favorite functions work

## 5 minute presentation

A **2 minute demo of your game**:
Show us the functionality!

Some questions might help you with the presentation:

- What is the game about?
- Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
- What features did you include?
  - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
- What was the most difficult part of the project?
- What was your favourate part to work on?
- What would you like to add next?

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Wireframe the Design of your Game** (draw out sketches of what your game will look like at different stages. Planning the design ahead of time removes the burden of designing as you code)
- **Write Pseudocode** Start by stating the problems in plain text. This will help you guide your process and understand the problem better.
- **Use your Developer Tools** (`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
  - Some great tutorials for the Developer Tools can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
- Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- **Project Workflow**: Did you complete the wireframes , pseudocode as specified above? Did you use source control (Git) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in?

- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as the D.R.Y. principle, indentation, and appropriately named variables? Did you comment your code to make the logic more understandable?

- **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

- **Presentation**: Did you present your game, your code, and your project-making experience clearly and effectively to the class?

- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a score for each section between:

| Score | Expectations                                         |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | _Incomplete._                                        |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations._                        |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_                      |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but **the more important scores are the individual ones** above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
